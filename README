STRUCTURE
(soon) There will be three files:
	scrabble.py	Stores the code for the Board and Square, as well as basic
			state-changing functions
	scrab_game.py	An implementation for a game of Scrabble
	scrab_ai.py	A Scrabble-playing AI for the scrabble.py version of the game

BOARD
A class Board in scrabble.py stores all the info for the board: board size, location
of bonuses, letter scores and frequencies (though the latter is really unnecessary),
as well as some basic functions that evaluate its state, and two functions that change
it.  These functions as local to the class as well as global:

Given this:
>>> b = Board()
>>> move = [('w',(0,0)),('o',(1,0)),('r',(2,0)),('d',(3,0))]

this
>>> new_b,score = make_move(b, move)
and this
>>> new_b,score = b.make_move(move)
are equivalent.

SQUARE
Very basic; just stores tile info and bonus info.  Board is a 2d list comprised of
Squares; it has a few state eval functions, but that's about it.
